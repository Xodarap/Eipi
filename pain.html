	A lot of speculation on non-human pain is through analogy. This table lists six things which seem to be important
	in human pain perception; by analogy, it seems that any being which also meets these criteria feels pain to some
	extent.
</p>
<p>
	This table is an update of Varner's 1998 table, which lists six criteria which seem to be important to human pain, and whether or not various non-human
	animals meet the criteria. The most significant ambiguity in this table is in the insects, as there is some
	evidence that pain perception is different across insects with exoskeletons versus those with endoskeletons. I marked
	"some" insects as having nociceptors, as I was unable to find a paper making the categorical statement "All insects
	have nociceptors."
</p>
<p>
	A "Y" means yes, blank means no, and question mark means the evidence is equivocal.

	Obviously, the greatest divide is between the vertebrates and the invertebrates. This isn't that surprising though,
	given that we are only asking which animals feel pain "like humans do," and our spine is a key factor of our
	bodies. An interesting note is that the only changes in the last 12 years have been from "No's" to "Yes's," i.e. 
	we are only finding more species with pain perception, not fewer.
</p>
<p>
	This raises the uncomfortable hypothesis that the only reason this table isn't entirely full of Y's is that 
	we just haven't studied invertebrates enough.
</p>
<h2>Why these criteria?</h2>

<p>Whatever the qualitative experience of pain comes from, it seems almost tautologically true that you first need to sense a
stimuli in order to find it painful. So the requirement for nociceptors (or a direct anologue) is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>The requirement of a centralized nervous system is probably equally straightforward at first glance: in order to
be in pain, there needs to be a singular, distinct entity who is in pain. Varner notes that "Insects do not favor damaged
limbs or become less active after internal injuries," implying that the "pain" insects feel, if any, is heavily localized.</p>
<p>If you have a mechanism to regulate pain, whether endogenous (i.e. created by the body) or through external drugs, 
that seems to indicate that the species has evolved not just to feel pain, but also to end pain that it feels. (Implying that
not only is pain there, but it can also in some circumstances be "bad.")</p>
<p>Most theories for the evolution of pain assume that at least part of its function is to move away from noxious stimuli.
Therefore, a lack of response seems to suggest a lack of pain sensing.</p>
