# Run the sb_server as a WinNT service.  Should work on Windows 2000
# and Windows XP.
#
# * Install as a service using "pop3proxy_service.py install"
# * Start the service (Use Control Panel etc, or
#   "pop3proxy_service.py start".  Check the event
#   log should anything go wrong.
# * To debug the service: "pop3proxy_service.py debug"
#   Service then runs in the command prompt, showing all
#   print statements.
# * To remove the service: "pop3proxy_service.py remove"
