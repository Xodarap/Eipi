"""An IMAP filter.  An IMAP message box is scanned and all non-scored
messages are scored and (where necessary) filtered.

The original filter design owed much to isbg by Roger Binns
(http://www.rogerbinns.com/isbg).

Usage:
    sb_imapfilter [options]

        note: option values with spaces in them must be enclosed
              in double quotes

        options:
            -p  dbname  : pickled training database filename
            -d  dbname  : dbm training database filename
            -t          : train contents of spam folder and ham folder
            -c          : classify inbox
            -h          : display this message
            -v          : verbose mode
            -P          : security option to prompt for imap password,
                          rather than look in options["imap", "password"]
            -e y/n      : expunge/purge messages on exit (y) or not (n)
            -i debuglvl : a somewhat mysterious imaplib debugging level
                          (4 is a good level, and suitable for bug reports)
            -l minutes  : period of time between filtering operations
            -b          : Launch a web browser showing the user interface.
                          (If not specified, and neither the -c or -t
                          options are used, then this will default to the
                          value in your configuration file).
            -o section:option:value :
                          set [section, option] in the options database
                          to value


Examples:

    Classify inbox, with dbm database
        sb_imapfilter -c -d bayes.db

    Train Spam and Ham, then classify inbox, with dbm database
        sb_imapfilter -t -c -d bayes.db

    Train Spam and Ham only, with pickled database
        sb_imapfilter -t -p bayes.db

Warnings:
    o This is alpha software!  The filter is currently being developed and
      tested.  We do *not* recommend using it on a production system unless
      you are confident that you can get your mail back if you lose it.  On
      the other hand, we do recommend that you test it for us and let us
      know if anything does go wrong.
    o By default, the filter does *not* delete, modify or move any of your
      mail.  Due to quirks in how imap works, new versions of your mail are
      modified and placed in new folders, but the originals are still
      available.  These are flagged with the /Deleted flag so that you know
      that they can be removed.  Your mailer may not show these messages
      by default, but there should be an option to do so.  *However*, if
      your mailer automatically purges/expunges (i.e. permanently deletes)
      mail flagged as such, *or* if you set the imap_expunge option to
      True, then this mail will be irretrievably lost.
"""

todo = """
To Do:
    o IMAPMessage and IMAPFolder currently carry out very simple checks
      of responses received from IMAP commands, but if the response is not
      "OK", then the filter terminates.  Handling of these errors could be
      much nicer.
    o IMAP over SSL is relatively untested.
    o Develop a test script, like spambayes/test/test_pop3proxy.py that
      runs through some tests (perhaps with a *real* imap server, rather
      than a dummy one).  This would make it easier to carry out the tests
      against each server whenever a change is made.
    o IMAP supports authentication via other methods than the plain-text
      password method that we are using at the moment.  Neither of the
      servers I have access to offer any alternative method, however.  If
      someone's does, then it would be nice to offer this.
    o Usernames should be able to be literals as well as quoted strings.
      This might help if the username/password has special characters like
      accented characters.
    o Suggestions?
