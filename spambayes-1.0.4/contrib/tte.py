"""
Train to exhaustion: train repeatedly on a pile of ham and spam until
everything scores properly.

usage %(prog)s [ -h ] -g file -s file [ -d file | -p file ] \
               [ -m N ] [ -r N ] [ -c ext ] [ -o sect:opt:val ] [ -v ]

-h      - Print this usage message and exit.

-g file - Take ham from file.

-s file - Take spam from file.

-d file - Use a database-based classifier named file.

-p file - Use a pickle-based classifier named file.

-m N    - Train on at most N messages (nham == N/2 and nspam == N/2).

-r N    - Run at most N rounds (default %(MAXROUNDS)s), even if not
          all messages score correctly.

-c ext  - Cull all messages which aren't used as training input during any run
          and write to new ham and spam files with ext as an extra file extension.
          All messages which are never considered (because one training set is
          longer than the other or the -m flag was used to reduce the amount of
          input) are retained.

-o sect:opt:val -
          Set [sect, opt] in the options database to val.

-v        Be very verbose, spewing all sorts of stuff out to stderr.

-R        Walk backwards through the mailbox.


Note: The -c command line argument isn't quite as benign as it might first
appear.  Since the tte protocol trains on the same number of ham and spam
messages, if you use the output of one run as input into a later run you
will almost certainly train on fewer messages than before since the two
files will probably not have the same number of messages.  The extra
messages in the longer file will be ignored in future runs until you add
more messages to the shorter file.

Note: Adding messages which train correctly won't affect anything other than
adding more ham or spam to the respective training pile.  To force such
messages to have an effect you should set your ham_cutoff and spam_cutoff
values closer to 0.0 and 1.0 than your normal settings during scoring.  For
example, if your normal ham_cutoff and spam_cutoff values are 0.2 and 0.8,
you might run %(prog)s like

    %(prog)s -o Categorization:ham_cutoff:0.05 \
        -o Categorization:spam_cutoff:0.95 \
        [ other args ]
